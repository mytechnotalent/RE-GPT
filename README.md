# RE-GPT
Drawing inspiration from Andrej Karpathy’s iconic lecture, "Let’s Build GPT: From Scratch, in Code, Spelled Out", this project takes you on an immersive journey into the inner workings of GPT. Step-by-step, we’ll construct a GPT model from the ground up, demystifying its architecture and bringing its mechanics to life through hands-on coding.
